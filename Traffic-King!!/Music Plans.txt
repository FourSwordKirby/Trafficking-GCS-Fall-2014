Huayun would like to suggest here that main screen, level selection and level info page should use
the same background music. Because the player can feel the situation "changes" when the BGM changes.
For example when you are watching a scary movie, suddenly a ghostly music starts and you will have
a sudden change in your mood. There should be a shift between a "relax" mood and a "game" mood for
our players.
